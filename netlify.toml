  # Allow npm to keep reporting succinct logs but give it more leeway to
  # download Netlify plugins from remote tarballs during CI. The previous
  # configuration forced a "prefer-offline" strategy which could time out
  # when Netlify needed to fetch private packages (see deploy failure for
  # task #458). We keep the useful flags while increasing the fetch timeout
  # and retry window so that transient network hiccups do not break the
  # build.
